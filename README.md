Looks like some other people also wrapped MDL, why use this one?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Because the ones I tried don't work. I'm trying to use MDL in some of my Meteor projects and there are issues that won't be fixed by just adding `material.js`.

What I've experienced so far:

* Can't export `componentHandler` with the official build since it's defined with the keyword `var`. To really ***use*** MDL, you need `componentHandler`.
* When using Iron:Router, template rendering happens ***after*** `document.load` event, so MDL upgrades nothing by itself.
* Even when not using Iron:Router, it's lucky that `document.load` works; when any MDL components get re-rendered by Blaze, they are screwed again. Because MDL won't automatically re-scan DOM for potential upgrades. Check out my [blaze demo](https://github.com/Zodiase/meteor-mdl/tree/master/integration-tests/issue1) without using this package to see how bad it is.

Features
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Exports `componentHandler` globally (Client Only).
* Exports `Mdl` globally on the client for changing settings in runtime.
	* If `MDl.envConfig['blazeFix'] === true` then the Blaze patch is effective. And only in this case:
		* `MDl.envConfig.patchers.blaze.getUpgradeStyle()` returns the current auto-upgrading style.
		* `MDl.envConfig.patchers.blaze.setUpgradeStyle('fullUpgrade' | 'mutationOnly' | 'none')` sets the auto-upgrade style.
			* `'fullUpgrade'` uses `componentHandler.upgradeAllRegistered()` when any mutation is observed.
			* `'mutationOnly'` uses `componentHandler.upgradeElements(mutation.target)` on mutations when any mutation is observed.
			* `'none'` does nothing.
* If you don't want auto-upgrading, turn it off with:
	* `if (MDl.envConfig['blazeFix']) MDl.envConfig.patchers.blaze.setUpgradeStyle('none');`
* Supports [Iron:Router](https://github.com/iron-meteor/iron-router).*

Install
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```Bash
$ meteor add zodiase:mdl
```

How to Use
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is nothing to do after installing the package. Enjoy! :D

Known Issues
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* ***Do not use MDL components at the top level of any templates or template event handlers may not work correctly.***
* Understand how MDL upgrades components and do not separate component elements into different templates unless you want to turn off auto-upgrading and do it manually.
