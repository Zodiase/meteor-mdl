[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Zodiase/meteor-mdl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Zodiase/meteor-mdl)

Features
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* **Theme color customization (See details below.)**

* **Full access to SASS source code (See details below.)**

* Exports `componentHandler` globally (Client Only).

* **It auto-upgrades everything for you by default, so you can sit back and relax.**

* Exports `MDl` globally on the client for changing settings in runtime.

    * `MDl.componentHandler` mirrors `componentHandler`.

    * `MDl.settings` stores a copy of the loaded settings. You should not modify it. Treat this as readonly.

    * `MDl.autoUpgrade` stores the instance of the autoUpgrader. Read more about it below.

Install
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```Bash
$ meteor add zodiase:mdl
```

How to Use
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After installing, create an empty settings file `zodiase-mdl.json` under the root of your app. **Without it most functions will be disabled.**

Other than that, there is nothing special to do. Enjoy! :D

### If you want to pick your own theme, like [what the MDL team have here](http://www.getmdl.io/customize/index.html), here's how:

1. First pick your theme colors from that page. You would have to pick both the **primary color** and the **accent color**.

2. Note that on the lower part of that page, there's a link that basically tells you what colors you have picked.

    * The link is always composed by `material.{primary}-{accent}.min.css`. I picked `deep_orange` and `blue` for example, and that link looks like `material.deep_orange-blue.min.css`.

3. Now create a `zodiase-mdl.json` file under the root of your app if you haven't already. This file stores the settings.

4. In that setting file, compose a JSON document that looks similar to this:

    ```JSON
    {
      "theme": {
        "primary": "deep_orange",
        "accent": "blue"
      }
    }
    ```

5. This will tell the package to load the corresponding theme file.

### If you want more than pre-built themes:

You can load up the SASS source code and define your own colors!

1. First you'd need to tell the package not to load any theme file.

    ```JSON
    {
      "theme": false
    }
    ```

2. Define your own theme colors and load MDL's SASS code.

    ```SASS
    // mdl-theme.scss
    $color-primary: "0,0,0";
    $color-accent: "255,255,255";
    @import '{zodiase:mdl}/theme';
    ```

3. There you go!

4. There's a full range of variables you can customize. Check out [MDL's variables](https://github.com/google/material-design-lite/blob/v1.2.0/src/_variables.scss) to learn more.

### If you want to import SASS files from MDL's source code:

They are all under `{zodiase:mdl-assets}/src` so have fun!

Auto Upgrade
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One big thing this package does for you is auto-upgrading everything.

This feature is enabled by default. You can disable it within the settings file:

```JSON
{
  "patches": {
    "autoUpgrade": false
  }
}
```

Doing so would turn off the entire auto-upgrader to save memory. However, this also means that you can NOT use it later in runtime. When auto-upgrader is turned off, `MDl.autoUpgrade === null`.

Aside from `false`, `autoUpgrade` can take one of the three other values: `["fullUpgrade"|"mutationOnly"|"none"]`, with `"fullUpgrade"` being the default.

* `"fullUpgrade"` uses `componentHandler.upgradeAllRegistered()` when any mutation is observed.

* `"mutationOnly"` uses `componentHandler.upgradeElements(mutation.target)` on mutations when any mutation is observed.

* `"none"` does nothing. However the observer still stays in the memory.

While at runtime and the auto-upgrader is not turned off in the settings, `MDl.autoUpgrade` is the instance of the auto-upgrader with the following interfaces:

* `MDl.autoUpgrade.getUpgradeStyle()` returns the current auto-upgrading style.

* `MDl.autoUpgrade.setUpgradeStyle("fullUpgrade" | "mutationOnly" | "none")` sets the auto-upgrade style.

Note that at this point in runtime it is impossible to turn off auto-upgrader any more. So `false` is not an acceptable value for `.setUpgradeStyle()`.

Known Issues
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* ***Do not use MDL components at the top level of any templates or template event handlers may not work correctly.***

* Understand how MDL upgrades components and do not separate the necessary elements of a component into different templates unless you want to turn off auto-upgrading and do it manually.

Versioning
